# MatLab

## This is a repository with 5 MatLab codes focused on electrical systems. 
Each uses a different law, with Gauss's or Coulomb's being the most representative.

### - Coulomb
This code calculates the electric force and the electric field with the Coulomb equation.

### - Alpha
This code calculates the angle of two charges hanging from threads

### - Separation of charged particles
Calculation of the distance between two charges that are dropped on an electric field.

### - Gauss's Law
This is a code that serves as a form to calculate the electric field of different situations using Gauss's law

### - Capacitance
